# Solidity_Practice

* More practice that I'm doing in Solidity on the Remix IDE online. *
These are a few smart contracts that I created from all of my resources outside of school on the internet.
All of these exercises are different programs that I created on the Remix IDE. Feel free to copy & paste one of the programs and plug it into the Remix IDE. Thank you 
for viewing my repository!
